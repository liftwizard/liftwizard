    <!--
    This suppression exists for bundles like SPARedirectFilterBundle that are abstract because they expect an anonymous inner subclass like:
    SPARedirectFilterBundle<T> spaRedirectFilterBundle = new SPARedirectFilterBundle<T>()
    {
        @Override
        public SPARedirectFilterFactory getSPARedirectFilterFactory(T configuration)
        {
            configuration.getSPARedirectFilterFactory();
        }
    };
    -->
    <suppress files="Bundle.java$" checks="AbstractClassName" />

    <!-- An example of a common suppression, though it's not necessary within Liftwizard -->
    <!--<suppress files="[\\/]generated-sources[\\/]" checks="[a-zA-Z0-9]*" />-->
