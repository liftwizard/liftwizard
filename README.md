# Liftwizard

Liftwizard is a collection of bundles and add-ons for [Dropwizard](https://www.dropwizard.io/), the Java framework for writing web services.

There are very few dependencies between the bundles, so you can pick and choose the ones you want.

## Module groups

The bundles can be loosely grouped into categories.
* Dropwizard configuration
* JSON serialization/deserialization
* Servlet client/server logging
* [Reladomo](https://github.com/goldmansachs/reladomo) ORM integration for Dropwizard
* Other Dropwizard utility
