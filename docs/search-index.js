this Whenever we use some of our Jersey resource methods will be authenticated The authenticated methods will be annotated with a security annotation such as The user principal will be passed in as a parameter and annotated like The header authorizer will take the string passed in the header in this example remove its prefix and make that string accessible via Since the header is sent on each request we can write tests involving multiple users For example we can write a test that asserts can create an entry and gets HTTP 201 Created cannot edit or delete the entry and gets HTTP 403 Forbidden can edit or delete the entry and gets HTTP 200 OK Production configuration The production authentication filter dependencies and configuration will depend on the method of authentication
