Liftwizard is a collection of bundles and add-ons for [Dropwizard](https://www.dropwizard.io/), the Java framework for writing web services.

There are very few dependencies between the bundles, so you can pick and choose the ones you want.

The bundles can be loosely grouped into categories:

- Dropwizard configuration and bundles
- Jackson JSON serialization/deserialization
- Servlet client/server logging
- [Reladomo](https://github.com/goldmansachs/reladomo) ORM integration for Dropwizard
- JUnit 4 and JUnit 5 test utilities
