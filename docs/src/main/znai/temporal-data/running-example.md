Many real-life applications support temporal services. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) supports all of the features listed in the [overview](temporal-data/temporal-data-overview).

In this section, we'll use [Factorio School](https://www.factorio.school/blueprints) as a running example. [Factorio School](https://www.factorio.school/) and [Factorio Prints](https://factorioprints.com/) are websites that lets users share designs, called [blueprints](https://wiki.factorio.com/Blueprint), for the video game [Factorio](https://factorio.com/). Liftwizard and Factorio School were both created by the [same author](https://github.com/motlin/) and Factorio School leverages Liftwizard's temporal support.

In the next section, we'll create and edit a blueprint, and see how non-destructive edits work.
